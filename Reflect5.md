  CSS style down the file.
- Style - Sets color, size, position.
- Sheets - You can have multiple files with multiple styles on the same site (not too common)
- Apply styles to tags.
- HTML is required to be able to apply the CSS code to.
- Start of CSS - link tag to start. 3 Attributes = type (text/css), rel (stylesheets), href (stylesheets). This goes inside the head of the html file. Stylesheet is the name of 
  the css file.
- CSS inside the html file takes priority over outsite css that's linked.
- CSS Box Model - Has 4 elemenst - Margin, Border, Padding, Content (from outer layer to inner layer).
- The farther down in the CSS file the rule is, the more priority it gets.
- Adobe Color Wheel is a good resource to find colors to use for your site. RGB = Red, Green, Blue (Hex Color); 255 is the largest value for to input for colors.
- You can write a CSS rule on the stylesheet, and then assign it to specific lines on the html file to apply it to that specific line.
- Class applies style to a group of elements on your website, while id applies it to a specific one.

**JavaScript**

- Adds logic to page. Makes page more dynamic.
- If you use float attribute, you need to use clear fix.
- Ctrl+back slash highlights CSS.
- // kebab or pascal or snake?
- Starts with var tag and a variable value (name).
- If a function comes out as "referenced undefined", check spelling.
- Always use triple equal for "if" arguments. You can use chain multiple true responses into the same "if" argument.
- Don't worry about windlow unload for this lab. One dynamic componen based on user input and one conditional statement; need a total of three.
