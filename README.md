# Welcome to Jack's Reading Notes for Code 102

**Growth Mindset:**
The _Growth Mindset_ is a critical element of continuous improvement. If you have a closed mind, you wouldn't have the need to find solutions that move you
forward. Having an open mind ensures that you are agile and always looking for ways to improve.

**3 Reminders to Keep Myself in a Growth Mentality:**
1. I can't move forward if I don't want to.
2. Constructive criticism is essential to growth.
3. Use mistakes, mine and others', to learn and grow.
