**About Git**

Git is important as it allows team members to collaborate on a file or project and tracks changes (commits) made throug time. Tracking changes or points through
the life of the projects makes for a streamlined process of having to go back to a specific point throughout the project to make changes, or to review certain
codes within the file or project. Git files or projects can be cloned to a local terminal on your computer where you can synchronize the two and make changes
on your local terminal and it will populate on your cloud platform, like github.com.

**Git Commands** 
ls - gets a listing of files within a directory
cd - changes which directory you are in and are currently controlling
mkdir - makes a new directory
rmdir - removes a directory
rm -r - removes a directory, all subdirectories and files (be careful as this is a hard delete)
pwd - shows the path to your current location within your directory or file

There are many others and some can be found on this [cheat sheet](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~valerie/courses/fall10/155/resources/unix_cheatsheet.html).

There are many different commands you can use on your terminal to control your git files. I've listed a few of them below with their functions:


**Visual Studio Code**
