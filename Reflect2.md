**Text Editor**

A text editor allows a developer to be able to write and translate text between coding language and reading language. There are multiple text editors available
and a developer should know what they're trying to do in order to pick the one that works best for them.


**Command Lines**

Command lines are what you use to interact with your computer by just typing codes. Instead of using your mouse to click an open up a file, you can use command lines
to tell the computer to find and open that file. Command lines can be used for many different functions. An example of a command is "cd" or change directory which can
be used to change between different files within your operating system. 


**Extensions**

An extension tells the user what type of file is within your operating system. Some files are read only, some files are editable and so on. Some commons types of
extensions are listed below:

file.exe - an executable file
file.txt - a plain text file
file.png/gif/jpg - an image file
